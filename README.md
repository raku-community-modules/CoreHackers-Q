CoreHackers::Q
==============

QAST tree visualizer

DESCRIPTION
===========

Installs `q` command line script that parses out QAST trees from a program and makes an HTML file from them.

The HTML page provides these extra features unavailable in plain `raku --target=ast` and `raku --target=optimize` output:

  * Control-click on individual tree nodes to collapse/expand them

  * Color coding: of sunk nodes, `QAST::Want` alternatives, static and non-static

calls, etc.

Example output:

USAGE
=====

        Usage:
          q a '[<args> ...]'
          q o '[<args> ...]'

`a` command
-----------

```bash
$ q a raku -e 'say "hello"' > out.html; google-chrome out.html
```

`a` stands for `--target=ast` and the args that follow is a `raku` invocation to run the script (the `--target=ast` argument will be inserted automatically).

The script will parse QAST generated by the given `raku` program and output an HTML file to STDOUT. View the file in any browser to examine the QAST tree.

`o` command
-----------

```bash
$ q o raku -e 'say "hello"' > out.html; google-chrome out.html
```

`o` stands for `--target=optimize` . Same as `a` , except parses `--target=optimize` QAST. Once again, you don't need to manually specify `--target` parameter.

`z` command
-----------

```bash
$ q z raku -e 'say "hello"'
```

Just runs the raku command as is. Mnemonic: "zero". This command exists simply to easily switch between ``a`/`o`` runs and plain raku runs.
